# 🕵️ Dark Pattern Detector

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Dark Pattern Detector** is a JavaScript-based tool designed to identify deceptive UI/UX practices on websites. These patterns manipulate users into making unintended decisions, such as subscribing to services, sharing personal data, or purchasing unwanted items. Our tool helps detect and highlight these patterns to promote ethical design.

This is a **partial project** and currently focuses on detecting dark patterns using **image analysis** and **DOM-based scanning** techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Automated Scanning:** Identifies common dark patterns like hidden fees, forced continuity, and trick questions.
- 🖼️ **Image Analysis:** Uses computer vision techniques to detect misleading UI elements.
- 📊 **Detailed Reports:** Provides insights into detected dark patterns with severity levels.
- 🌐 **Browser Integration:** Can be used as a browser extension or bookmarklet.
- 📜 **Custom Rule Engine:** Allows users to define their own rules for pattern detection.
- 📢 **User Alerts:** Notifies users when deceptive elements are found on a webpage.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend (Optional):** Node.js (if needed for data analysis)
- **Tools & Libraries:** Regex, DOM Manipulation, Chrome Extension API, OpenCV.js (for image analysis)
